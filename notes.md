## Migrations

- Every change to the database schema needs a new migration.

- Don't DO ROLL Back in PRODUCTION

Characters Table

- id => generated by the Database
- name = | string | up to 256 characters long | required (Not NULL) | indexed (makes searches by name faster)
- house = | string | up to 128 characters | optional (NULL)
- origin = | string | up to 256 | optional
- alive = | boolean |

Need a single place to configure our connection to the database (Knex).

- npm i -g knex for global installation

- knex init = creates knex file
- open knexfile.js to configure the connection

- SQLite does not honor string lengths
